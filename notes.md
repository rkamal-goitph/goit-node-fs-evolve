- Why do we need to set a schema?
- THERE IS NO STRICT UNIFORM FORMAT THAT IS FOLLOWED FOR DATA BEING SAVED IN MONGODB

- SCHEMA
- enforces uniformity across the data or document fields being saved in the mongodb collection
- this does not mean that all of the fields we declare in the schema is mandatory
- there is an option for us to assign a mandatory or required field
- and its also possible for us to make a field optional
- the important thing is that all the fields that can be added in the document object must adhere to the fields declared in the document schema

- Syntax for creating a Schema
  const ContactSchema = mongoose.Schema;

- MVC Architecture
- Model View Controller Architecture
- Model refers to the schema that we are applying the our object models
- View refers to the data presentation for the response from the route
- Controller refers to the function managing the responses of our routes
